# Behavioral test design recipe

Project opt-in when adding meaningful behavior, preventing regressions, or repairing weak/flaky tests. Use the existing project runner and conventions.

1. Name the contract and realistic failure: wrong branch, malformed input, missing state change, ordering violation, boundary value, or incorrect external operation.
2. Choose an observable boundary that reaches the bug. Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests serve different evidence needs; choose by behavior and isolation cost rather than a fixed preference.
3. Derive expected results independently. Use worked examples, literal fixtures, invariants, or a trusted independent implementation. Do not reconstruct the production algorithm inside the expected value.
4. Keep the logic under test real. Substitute nondeterministic and external dependencies narrowly; model relevant side effects faithfully. Verify an external call when that call is itself the contract.
5. For new test-first work, take one behavior through failing test, minimal passing implementation, and safe refactoring. For existing changes, prove the regression check detects the broken behavior when feasible without disturbing user work.
6. Review whether plausible wrong implementations would still pass. Strengthen assertions only around actual risks. Test through public behavior where useful; a project's internal invariant can merit focused tests too.
7. Run the affected tests and required gates. Preserve distinct coverage during refactoring; remove duplicates only after establishing what they protect.

Avoid tests that only assert a constant equals its configured literal or source text contains itself. A source/configuration test is useful when it validates a real contract, schema, reference, or consumer requirement.
